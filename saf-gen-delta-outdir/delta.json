Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.\n\nA privileged function in PostgreSQL/database context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, its built-in logic, or its security settings. This would include all Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and all security-related statements. In an SQL environment, it encompasses, but is not necessarily limited to: \n\nCREATE\nALTER\nDROP\nGRANT\nREVOKE\n\nThere may also be Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements that, subject to context, should be regarded as privileged. Possible examples include:\n\nTRUNCATE TABLE;\nDELETE, or\nDELETE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or\nDELETE without a WHERE clause;\n\nUPDATE or\nUPDATE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or\nUPDATE without a WHERE clause;\n\nany SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to an application-defined security table executed by other than a security principal.\n\nDepending on the capabilities of PostgreSQL and the design of the database and associated applications, the prevention of unauthorized use of privileged functions may be achieved by means of DBMS security features, database triggers, other mechanisms, or a combination of these.\n\nHowever, the use of procedural languages within PostgreSQL, such as pl/R and pl/Python, introduce security risk. Any user on the PostgreSQL who is granted access to pl/R or pl/Python is able to run UDFs to escalate privileges and perform unintended functions. Procedural languages such as pl/Perl and pl/Java have \"untrusted\" mode of operation, which do not allow a non-privileged PostgreSQL user to escalate privileges or perform actions as a database administrator.",

Unlimited concurrent connections to PostgreSQL could allow a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources; and a system can also fail or be degraded by an overload of legitimate users. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user is helpful in reducing these risks.\n\nThis requirement addresses concurrent session control for a single account. It does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system accounts; and it does not deal with the total number of sessions across all accounts.\n\nThe capability to limit the number of concurrent sessions per user must be configured in or added to PostgreSQL (for example, by use of a logon trigger), when this is technically feasible. Note that it is not sufficient to limit sessions via a web server or application server alone, because legitimate users and adversaries can potentially connect to PostgreSQL by other means.\n\nThe organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent sessions by account type, by account, or a combination thereof. In deciding on the appropriate number, it is important to consider the work requirements of the various types of users. For example, 2 might be an acceptable limit for general users accessing the database via an application; but 10 might be too few for a database administrator using a database management GUI tool, where each query tab and navigation pane may count as a separate session.\n\n(Sessions may also be referred to as connections or logons, which for the purposes of this requirement are synonyms.)",

However, it is possible for clients to override the default and attempt to establish an unencrypted connection. To prevent connections made from non-local hosts from being unencrypted, the postgres host-based authentication settings should be configured to only allow hostssl (i.e., encrypted) connections.

The intent of this control is to establish grounds for confidence at each end of a communications session in the ongoing identity of the other party and in the validity of the information being transmitted. \n\nSession IDs are tokens generated by PostgreSQLs to uniquely identify a user's (or process's) session. DBMSs will make access decisions and execute logic based on the session ID.\n\nUnique session IDs help to reduce predictability of said identifiers. Unique session IDs address man-in-the-middle attacks, including session hijacking or insertion of false information into a session. If the attacker is unable to identify or guess the session information related to pending application traffic, they will have more difficulty in hijacking the session or otherwise manipulating valid sessions. \n\nWhen a user logs out, or when any other session termination event occurs, PostgreSQL must terminate the user session(s) to minimize the potential for sessions to be hijacked.",

Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.\n\nA privileged function in PostgreSQL/database context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, its built-in logic, or its security settings. This would include all Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and all security-related statements. In an SQL environment, it encompasses, but is not necessarily limited to: \n\nCREATE\nALTER\nDROP\nGRANT\nREVOKE\n\nThere may also be Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements that, subject to context, should be regarded as privileged.

Any user on the PostgreSQL who is granted access to pl/R or pl/Python is able to run UDFs to escalate privileges and perform unintended functions. Procedural languages such as pl/Perl and pl/Java have \"untrusted\" mode of operation, which do not allow a non-privileged PostgreSQL user to escalate privileges or perform actions as a database administrator.",

With SSL enabled, connections made to the database server will default to being encrypted.  However, it is possible for clients to override the default and attempt to establish an unencrypted connection. To prevent connections made from non-local hosts from being unencrypted, the postgres host-based authentication settings should be configured to only allow hostssl (i.e., encrypted) connections.  The hostssl connections can be further configured to require that the client present a valid (trusted) SSL certificate for a connection."

However, it is possible for clients to override the default and attempt to establish an unencrypted connection. To prevent connections made from non-local hosts from being unencrypted, the postgres host-based authentication settings should be configured to only allow hostssl (i.e., encrypted) connections.

These cryptographic mechanisms may be native to\nPostgreSQL or implemented via additional software or operating system/file system\nsettings, as appropriate to the situation.\n\nSelection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the integrity\nof organizational information. The strength of the mechanism is commensurate with\nthe security category and/or classification of the information. Organizations have\nthe flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e., full\ndisk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records, or\nfields).\n\nThe decision whether and what to encrypt rests with the data owner and is also\ninfluenced by the physical measures taken to secure the equipment and media on which\nthe information resides.",
